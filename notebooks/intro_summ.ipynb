    "\n",
    "**DSPy** emphasizes programming over prompting. It unifies techniques for **prompting** and **fine-tuning** LMs as well as improving them with **reasoning** and **tool/retrieval augmentation**, all expressed through a _minimalistic set of Pythonic operations that compose and learn_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DSPy** provides **composable and declarative modules** for instructing LMs in a familiar Pythonic syntax. On top of that, **DSPy** introduces an **automatic compiler that teaches LMs** how to conduct the declarative steps in your program. The **DSPy compiler** will internally _trace_ your program and then **craft high-quality prompts for large LMs (or train automatic finetunes for small LMs)** to teach them the steps of your task."

Whether they are there for their own protection, for disciplinary reasons, or to separate them from a codefendant while they await trial for years, the conditions are equally deplorable. Plaintiffs are locked in a small cell alone almost continuously, where they languish in a state of forced idleness. They cannot interact with other inmates. Family cannot visit them. They cannot participate in religious, educational or rehabilitative programs. They are never even allowed outdoors. Research shows that such social and environmental deprivations are toxic to the human brain. Instead of promoting public safety, these conditions cause inmates to spiral into mental illness before they are released to the community. Courts, advocates and prison administrators across the country are recognizing the costs of excessive isolation. The\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 2 of 13 PageID: 2\\nconstitutional standards of decency are evolving. Plaintiffs bring this class action seeking to remedy the unconstitutional conditions in C-Pod, and say:\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3) and (4). Plaintiffs bring claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for the deprivation of rights secured by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 2. Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in this judicial district and the parties reside in this district.\\nPARTIES 3. Plaintiff Azariah Lazar is a pretrial detainee housed in “C-Pod” at the Middlesex County Adult Correction Center located at U.S. Route 130 and Apple Orchard Lane, North Brunswick, NJ 08902. Mr. Lazar has been in C-Pod since February 2015. 4. Plaintiff Luis Borrero is awaiting trial and housed in C-Pod. He is also serving a sentence in Pennsylvania. Mr. Borrero has been in C-Pod since June 2015. 5. Plaintiff Hector Amengual is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since May 2014. 6. Plaintiff Sean Pershing is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since September 2015. 7. Plaintiff Tyson Ratliff is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since September 2015. 8. Plaintiff Jonathan Rodriguez is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since September 2015.\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 3 of 13 PageID: 3\\n9. Plaintiff Terrence Edwards is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since October 2015.\\n10. Plaintiff Damani Harris is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since October 2014. 11. Plaintiff Patrick O’Dwyer is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since November 2014. 12. Defendant Middlesex County is a body politic with a principal business address at the County Administration Building, 75 Bayard Street, New Brunswick, NJ 08901. The subdivision of the County responsible for the jail is the Office of Adult Corrections and Youth Services.\\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS 13. Plaintiffs bring this action individually and on behalf of all persons who are now or will be housed in C-Pod during the pendency of this lawsuit, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2). 14. This is a fluid class of about 50 individuals at a given time and is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. 15. There are questions of law or fact common to the class. All individuals in C-Pod are subject to the same conditions, the constitutionality of which will be determined under either the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments. 16. The claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class. 17. The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. There are no conflicts between the Plaintiffs and other class members. No class member has an interest in maintaining the current inhumane conditions in C-Pod.\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 4 of 13 PageID: 4\\n18. The party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\\n19. Plaintiffs have retained competent and experienced counsel who will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. The Public Defender has done substantial work in investigating and identifying potential claims in the action and has experience in handling class actions. This experience includes prosecuting class action claims on behalf of inmates in county jails and state prisons throughout New Jersey. Accordingly, the Public Defender has knowledge of the applicable law and procedures that relate to these claims. Finally, in what can be described as the largest public interest law firm in the State of New Jersey, the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender will commit substantial resources to representing the class.\\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 20. Plaintiffs are inmates housed in an area of the Correction Center known as C-Pod, a cluster of maximum-security cells spanning four levels of the jail. 21. There are about 50 inmates in C-Pod. 22. The cells in C-Pod are smaller than a parking space. They have narrow windows that are sealed shut, many of which are painted over, preventing the inmates from looking outside. Other windows are so dirty that only a faint glow of sunlight comes through. Aside from a small window and a slot for food, the doors are solid metal. 23. The cells are equipped with a combination toilet-sink, a bed with a thin foam mattress, and a small desk. There is no chair for the desk, so inmates must either sit on the concrete floor or the bed.\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 5 of 13 PageID: 5\\n24. In C-Pod, time passes in long silences broken by the sudden outbursts of the mentally ill, who scream, bang on the walls and toilets, and jump on the beds in their cells.\\n25. The air in C-Pod is dusty, tinged with sewage, and inadequately ventilated; it causes some Plaintiffs to have nosebleeds or asthma attacks.\\n26. The air in C-Pod is uncomfortably cold at all times. Inmates are provided with only one, thin blanket, which exacerbates the discomfort.\\n27. The cells are infested with flies, roaches, centipedes and other insects. 28. There is black mold in the shower facilities. 29. Many of the cells have leaky plumbing, causing rank water to pool on the floor. 30. The inmates are confined alone in their cells 5 days a week for 23 hours a day, and 2 days a week for 24 hours. 31. The inmates’ only form of stimuli comes in the form of an antiquated book delivered by library staff. 32. On days when an inmate can leave his cell for an hour, he may not interact with, or even speak to, any other inmates. He may only shower by himself or pace around in one of the small, 10x10 chain-link cages inside C-Pod. Some of the cages face a television controlled by the officer on duty, and some have a telephone that inmates can use if they have sufficient funds. 33. Officers are not always scrupulous in allowing an inmate his full hour. 34. The hourly schedule for when an inmate may leave his cell is not consistent. For example, an inmate may be permitted to leave for an hour at 6 a.m. on one day but 6 p.m. on the following day, meaning he will remain alone in his cell for much longer than 24 hours even during the 5 days he is permitted to leave his cell.\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 6 of 13 PageID: 6\\n35. Unlike inmates in the general population, inmates in C-Pod are never allowed to: A. Eat meals away from their toilets or with other inmates; B. Have in-person visits from family, friends or loved ones; C. Participate in religious groups or services; D. Participate in groups or programs designed to educate or rehabilitate them; E. Access the law library to research their cases; F. Access the computer laboratory; or G. Go outside for exercise, recreation, and their overall well-being, meaning Plaintiff Hector Amengual, for example, has not been exposed to fresh air and natural sunlight for over 1.5 years.\\n36. The inability to go outside or even walk in one direction for more than 10 feet causes inmates a number of physical maladies, such as stiffness of the joints and backaches.\\n37. Unlike inmates in the general population, inmates in C-Pod have restricted access to their attorneys.\\nA. If they do not have sufficient funds to use the telephone in one of the 10x10 cages, an inmate’s only way of contacting his attorney by phone is through a social worker who visits between once a week and once a month.\\nB. Attorneys wishing to meet with an inmate in C-Pod are routinely subject to long wait times and limited timeframes in which to conduct the meeting. For example, the afternoon visitation hours at the Correction Center are between 2-4 p.m., but attorneys wishing to visit with a C-Pod client must wait until 3:30 p.m. to accommodate “window checks” that are scheduled during attorney visitation hours. And when the meetings do occur, they are short and\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 7 of 13 PageID: 7\\nharried because of the time constraints and because there is only one meeting room in the pod. C. Additionally, the physical layout of the attorney-client meeting room impairs an inmate’s access to his attorney. There is no desk or table at which the attorney and client may sit. Instead, the room is divided in two by a chainmetal partition, with the inmate on one side and his attorney on the other. 38. These conditions, separately and in combination, deprive Plaintiffs of the minimal necessities of civilized life and cause them unnecessary pain and suffering. This is of grave constitutional concern. 39. Solitary confinement lasting more than 10 days results in a distinct set of emotional, cognitive, social, and physical pathologies. 40. Solitary confinement creates or exacerbates serious mental health problems and anti-social behavior, and leads to an increased rate of recidivism after release. 1 41. Because solitary confinement deprives the subject of social and environmental stimulation, it is “toxic to brain functioning and causes symptoms characteristic of stupor and delirium.”2 42. Neurological effects may include perceptual distortions, illusions, and hallucinations; panic attacks; difficulties with thinking, concentration, and memory; frightening and uncontrollable fantasies, such as those involving revenge, torture, or mutilation; paranoid and persecutory delusions; and problems with impulse control.\\n1 Vera Institute of Justice Safe Alternatives to Segregation Initiative, Request for Proposals for Technical Assistance Sites, http://www.vera.org/project/safe-alternatives-segregation-initiative. 2 Stuart Grassian, Psychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 Wash. U. J. L. & Pol’y 325, 348 (2006).\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 8 of 13 PageID: 8\\n43. The motor effects of those subject to solitary confinement range from a state of restlessness, yelling, and banging at one end of the spectrum to a kind of regressed, dissociated, withdrawn, hypnoid state at the other.\\n44. Suicide rates and incidents of self-mutilation (such as banging one’s head against the cell wall) are much higher for people in segregation than those in the general prison population.\\n45. In C-Pod, inmates who exhibit some of these disturbed behaviors are stripped naked and put in a thin mesh gown known as “the chicken suit” and held for hours or days in a cold, empty observation cell without a bed or even a blanket.\\n46. These types of conditions may cause prolonged or permanent psychiatric disability, including impairments which destroy the inmate\\'s capacity to reintegrate into the community upon release.\\n47. Plaintiffs are suffering from some or all of the foregoing effects. 48. The conditions in C-Pod violate the evolving standards of decency in the United States towards incarcerated people.\\nA. The Association of State Correctional Administrators has now recognized solitary confinement as “a grave problem.”3\\nB. Justice Kennedy of the United States Supreme Court recently called on the Judiciary to examine the practice of confining an inmate to near-total isolation for an extended period of time.4\\n3 George Camp et al., New Report on Prisoners in Administrative Segregation Prepared by the Association of State Correctional Administrators and the Arthur Liman Public Interest Program at Yale Law School, http://www.asca.net/system/assets/attachments/8895/ASCA%20LIMAN%20Press%20Release%208-2815.pdf?1441222595. 4 Davis v. Ayala, 135 S. Ct. 2187, 2210 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring).\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 9 of 13 PageID: 9\\nC. President Obama recently directed the Attorney General to review the overuse of solitary confinement across American prisons.5\\nD. The American Bar Association now recommends that “[s]egregated housing should be for the briefest term and under the least restrictive conditions practicable and consistent with the rationale for placement and with the progress achieved by the prisoner.”6\\nE. The Committee against Torture, the official body established under the United Nations’ Convention against Torture, advocates a “ban [on] solitary confinement regimes in prisons.”7\\n49. Whether solitary confinement should be abolished altogether is debatable. 50. But even if some inmates must be separated, that can be done without the extreme social isolation and sensory deprivations inflicted by the conditions in C-Pod. The conditions in C-Pod are excessive in relation to the purposes assigned to them. 51. There are a number of ways that Defendant can alleviate the harm to which Plaintiffs are subjected, even if they are still confined in C-Pod. Some of these include, but are not limited to: providing access to an outdoor exercise area; increasing the time out of cell; permitting in-person visits with family, friends and loved ones; providing in-cell programming via headphones or speakers in cells that play radio, television or educational information; permitting inmates in C-Pod to interact with one another, such as by eating together; or giving inmates opportunities to increase privileges through good behavior.\\n5 https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/14/remarks-president-naacp-conference. 6 ABA, Standards for Criminal Justice: Treatment of Prisoners 50, Standard 23-2.6 (Rationales for segregated housing) (3d. ed. 2011). 7 U.N.

For example, New York offers prisoners incell programming via headphones and a jack in their cells that plays radio, television, and other programs. Colorado now requires that incarcerated people held in its Management Control Unit receive four hours of time outside their cell each day. Maine requires that incarcerated people in segregated housing receive group recreation, counseling sessions, and opportunities to increase privileges through good behavior, as well as greater access to radios, televisions, and reading materials. And in a national survey of administrative segregation practices, “44 of 46 responding jurisdictions had an outdoor exercise area.”8\\n53. These changes are also financially feasible. Defendant has sufficient resources to remedy its constitutional defects: in 2014, Middlesex County’s total appropriations were $454,043,454, with $12,761,636 in reserves at the end of the fiscal year.9\\n54.

In light of the known effects of solitary confinement, the conditions in C-Pod are not reasonably related to legitimate purposes.\\n58. These conditions cause inmates deprivations and hardships over an extended period of time and are excessive in relation to the purposes assigned to them.\\n59. Therefore, the conditions in C-Pod constitute punishment of pretrial detainees in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nCount II Cruel and Unusual Punishment in Violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution 60. The above facts are incorporated by reference here as if set forth at length. 61. The United States Constitution requires the government to respect the human attributes even of those who have committed serious crimes. 62. The Eighth Amendment’s scope must change as the basic mores of society change. 63. The conditions of C-Pod deprive inmates of the minimal necessities of civilized life and cause profound and obvious psychological pain and suffering. This suffering is unnecessary and wanton. 64. Under these circumstances, Defendant knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health. 65. Therefore, the conditions in C-Pod inflict cruel and unusual punishment on sentenced inmates, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\\nCount III Restriction on the Right of Access to the Courts\\nin Violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution 66.

The Constitution guarantees inmates a right of access to the courts. This right applies to both criminal proceedings and civil proceedings in which an inmate is challenging the conditions of his confinement.\\n68. Inmates in C-Pod are completely deprived of access to the Correction Center’s law library.\\n69. The conditions in C-Pod restricting attorney visitation severely impair their access to counsel.\\n70. Therefore, detainees in C-Pod are subject to restrictions that impair their right of access to the courts, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF Wherefore, Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the class they represent, ask the Court to: A.

For the reasons that follow, it is respectfully\\n\\nrecommended that Ratliff’s claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\\n\\nBackground and Procedural History\\n\\nOn November 5, 2015, Plaintiffs, who were inmates housed at the Middlesex County Adult\\n\\nCorrection Center in “C-Pod,” a unit for solitary confinement, initiated this litigation by filing their\\n\\nComplaint against Middlesex County, challenging the social and environmental deprivations\\n\\nexperienced by inmates in C-Pod, alleging that said deprivations violated their constitutional\\n\\nrights. (See generally, Pl. Cmplt.; Docket Entry No. 1). Specifically, Plaintiffs brought claims for\\n\\n(1) unconstitutional punishment of pretrial detainees under the Fourteenth Amendment (Count I);\\n\\n(2) cruel and unusual punishment under the Eight Amendment (Count II); and (3) unconstitutional\\n\\nrestrictions on the right of access to the courts under the Fourteenth Amendment. (Id). A week\\n\\nafter Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, they sought to certify a class. (Pl. Motion to Certify Class;\\n\\nDocket Entry No. 3). This motion was ultimately withdrawn at Plaintiffs’ request in order to give\\n\\nthe American Civil Liberties Union (“ACLU”), which had decided to enter an appearance on\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 2 of 11 PageID: 151\\nbehalf of Plaintiffs, an opportunity to become acclimated with the case. (See Letter Order of 1/4/2016; Docket Entry No. 14).\\nMiddlesex County responded to Plaintiffs’ Complaint on December 17, 2015, denying that any constitutional violations had occurred. (See generally, Def. Answer; Docket Entry No. 11). After Defendant answered, the Court scheduled the Initial Conference in this matter. (Initial Scheduling Order of 1/5/2016; Docket Entry No. 15). During the Initial Conference, the Court set a schedule for certain discovery necessary to facilitate the parties’ settlement discussions. (See Scheduling Order of 3/1/2016; Docket Entry No. 21). Said discovery ensued and the parties’ settlement discussions progressed. (See Text Orders of 8/22/2016 & 10/6/2016; Docket Entry Nos. 25 & 26).\\nIn light of the development of the parties’ discussions, the Court scheduled an in-person status conference for January 30, 2017 for the purpose of discussing settlement. (Text Order of 12/6/2016; Docket Entry No. 27).1 During the conference, it became apparent that the parties’ negotiations had progressed significantly, with substantial headway having been made. As a result, the Court arranged to follow up with the parties via telephone on May 24, 2017.\\nOn May 24, 2017, the Court stayed discovery in order to further facilitate the parties’ settlement discussions. The Court also set a schedule for the parties’ exchanges of settlement proposals. (See Letter Order of 5/25/2017; Docket Entry No. 29). The parties continued to exchange settlement proposals and it appeared that a settlement had been reached with 8 of 9 of the named Plaintiffs having signed the settlement agreement by June 19, 2018. The only Plaintiff who had not signed the settlement agreement was Ratliff, though during a conference held on June 19, 2018, counsel indicated that Ratliff was not unhappy with the agreement, but nevertheless did\\n1 The conference was later moved to February 16, 2017. (Letter Order of 1/19/2017; Docket Entry No. 28).\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 3 of 11 PageID: 152\\nnot want to sign same. Given Ratliff’s refusal to sign the settlement agreement, the Court scheduled a telephonic settlement conference exclusively for Ratliff and his attorney for July 10, 2018. (Text Minute Entry of 6/19/2018). As the Court explained:\\nSo I scheduled a telephone conference for July 10th to, again, discuss the settlement with Mr. Duddy and Mr. Ratliff separate from the defendants. It was my intention to explore with him what Mr. Ratliff’s position was, if he had any concerns, if he wasn’t interested in the settlement, all of the concerns that a Court would address when we’re conducting an in-person settlement conference. . . . I thought I could at least tease-out and explore, again, with Mr. Ratliff informally what his concerns were, and perhaps address with Mr. Duddy any of the issues that he had, and maybe eliminate them, and move this along for a settlement. (Tr. of Proceedings of 7/26/2017 at 4:7-22; Docket Entry No.41). However, despite being aware of the scheduled telephonic settlement conference, Ratliff did not participate in same. As a result, on July 12, 2018, the Court entered a Letter Order to Show Cause in which Ratliff was ordered to appear in person before the undersigned on July 26, 2018 at 10:30 a.m. to show cause for his failure to participate in the scheduled July 10, 2018 conference. (Letter Order to Show Cause of 7/12/2018 at 1; Docket Entry No. 39). Ratliff was also directed to submit a written explanation regarding his failure to participate in the July 10, 2018 conference by July 24, 2018. (Id .at 2). Further, Ratliff was specifically warned that if he failed to comply with the Court’s Order to Show Cause, his claims could be dismissed from this matter: Should Plaintiff Ratliff fail to submit the written explanation or fail to appear in person on July 26, 2018 as ordered, both monetary and nonmonetary sanctions may be imposed, including the dismissal of his claims. (Id.) Despite the foregoing, Ratliff neither submitted a written explanation nor appeared in person at the show cause hearing.\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 4 of 11 PageID: 153\\nDuring the show cause hearing, the Court confirmed through his counsel that Ratliff was\\naware of the Court’s Order to Show Cause, the requirement that he submit a written explanation,\\nthe requirement that he appear in person, and the potential dispositive consequences failing to\\ncomply with the Court’s Order could have for him:\\nTHE COURT: I will now turn to, Mr. Duddy, and as I discussed off-the-record with you, I am not interested in encroaching upon your attorney-client communications. What you have a responsibility to do, however, is to report to the Court, did you, in fact, provide this letter order to Mr. Ratliff, as I had instructed? What’s your understanding of whether or not he received this letter; was aware of today’s appearance order to show cause hearing; whether he was aware of the July 24th submission date; and more importantly, if you have any indication of whether or not he intended to participate; and if he has any interest in proceeding with this litigation?\\nThat last aspect, I will note that there have been times where parties have somewhat compelled the Court to move forward while they are not interested in pursuing the litigation, they can’t be bothered, mind you, of even withdrawing the complaint or officially indicating that they no longer want to participate, and then we have to go through these steps.\\nSo, if I could -- that was very longwinded, but, Mr. Duddy, if you outline the steps that you have taken to communicate this letter with Mr. Ratliff, its import, and if you have any indication of whether or not he intended to continue with this litigation. You can remain seated, too.\\nMR. DUDDY: Thank you, Your Honor.\\nOn Monday -- on the morning of Monday, July 16th, I texted Mr. Ratliff a picture of the Court’s order to show cause. And that’s been the way that I’ve been communicating with Mr. Ratliff for some time now, probably going on six months via text message, that is.\\nSo I took a picture of the order to show cause, I text it to him.\\nAlso in the body of my text message, I kind of pointed out or highlighted the substance of the order, which was that he was to provide either me or the Court with a written explanation by July\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 5 of 11 PageID: 154\\n24th as to why he did not participate in the telephone conference on July 10th. And also, that he is to report in person to the Court with me today, July 26th. So, again, that was in the body of my text, in addition to sending him a picture of the order to show cause.\\nThe text message went through to Mr. Ratliff from my end. I then followed up my text message with a phone call to him later that day. He took my phone call, and I then reiterated, again, the body of my text to him verbally and the substance of the Court order, very slowly and clearly, so as to make sure that he understood. And I finished the phone call by asking that he text me back to confirm receipt of my earlier text messages. And he simply just responded “okay” or “fine,” something to that effect.\\nHe did not text me back later that day, or the next day, despite my repeated text messages to him in those days asking for him to confirm receipt.\\nI then mailed -- I overnight via overnight mail a hard copy version of the order to show cause to his last known address in New York, New York. It’s my understanding that that package is being returned, as of yesterday, because the occupant of his last known address is something other than him, and that person would not accept receipt of the package.\\nSo a couple days after that, after my initial text message to him on July 16th -- and I apologize if I’m jumping around -- but I would say July 18th and 19th, I called him two separate times to remind him of the text messages, and to remind him or ask him to confirm receipt of those text messages.\\nEach time I placed that call to him, he took my call. But midway through my explanation to him as to what I was asking him to do, he hung up on me both times.\\nAnd so those were my efforts to ensure that he received the Court’s order to show cause on July 12th.\\nI’m very confident that he did receive the order to show cause via text message. As I said, that has been our custom, that’s been our way of corresponding with one another, and the message did go through on my side.\\nAnd then, of course, in my conversation with him on July 16th, I repeated the substance and import of the order to show cause.\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 6 of 11 PageID: 155\\nSo I am confident that he did receive it, that he did understand the main aspects of it. And he’s not here today, and so I’m also confident that he’s not going to be showing up today before the Court.\\nAnd similarly, it’s my belief that he no longer wants to take part in this litigation, or prosecute this lawsuit of which he is a part.\\nHe did, I will add, finally, for the record, that about a week later -- a week after July 16th, thereabouts, and this would only be a couple days ago, he sent me a text message, seemingly out of the blue, more or less expressing his displeasure with the Middlesex County Jail. The text message neither answered the Court’s order to show cause, nor did it confirm receipt of my delivery of the order to show cause. It was something of an irrelevant non sequitur about some issue entirely different.\\nSo, again, given all those circumstances, I do not believe that he wishes to prosecute this lawsuit.\\nTHE COURT: One question. When you mentioned that you believe he understood the import of the order to show cause, did that include -- is it your impression that Mr. Ratliff realized that he could be dismissed as a complainant in this matter if he did not come forward today?\\nMR. DUDDY: It did include that, Your Honor, and I apologize for leaving that out of my summation here. When I spoke to him -- well, when I texted him the picture of the order to show cause, included in the body of my text was the information that if he did not comply with the order, he could be subject to sanctions/punishment, including his dismissal from the lawsuit, so that was in the body of my text. And I also repeated that to him in my phone conversation on the 16th. I repeated that to him slowly and clearly so as to make sure that he understood that.\\nSo to answer Your Honor’s question, yes, I do believe that he understands that as a consequence of not following through with the order to show cause, he could be dismissed from the lawsuit.\\n(Tr. of Proceedings of 7/26/2017 at 6:1 – 10:13). After confirming the foregoing, the Court\\nindicated its intention to enter a Report and Recommendation, recommending that Ratliff’s claims\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 7 of 11 PageID: 156\\nbe dismissed for “failure to comply with this Court’s orders and, equally as important, to prosecute his case.” (Id. at 11:10-11).\\nAnalysis The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize courts to impose sanctions for failure to provide discovery, obey court orders and/or prosecute a case. See FED.R.CIV.P. 37(b)(2), 41(b). Where such failures have occurred, dismissal may be an appropriate penalty. Id. Generally, in determining whether to impose an involuntary order of dismissal with prejudice, the Court considers the factors set forth in Poulis v. State Farm Casualty Co., 747 F.2d , 863, 868 (3d Cir. 1984). These factors include:\\n(1) The extent of the party’s personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the adversary caused by the plaintiff’s conduct; (3) the history of dilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct of the party or the attorney was willful or in bad faith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which entails an analysis of alternative sanctions; and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim. Id. No single Poulis factor is determinative and dismissal may be appropriate even if some of the factors are not met. See Mindek v. Rigatti, 964 F.2d 1369, 1373 (3d Cir. 1992); Hicks v. Feeney, 850 F.2d 152, 156 (3d Cir. 1988). If a court finds dismissal appropriate under Poulis, it may dismiss an action sua sponte, pursuant to its inherent powers and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). See Iseley v. Bitner, 216 Fed App’x 252, 254-55 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962)). The Court considers the Poulis factors in determining whether to recommend the dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice. For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that under the circumstances presented here, the Poulis factors support the dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice:\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 8 of 11 PageID: 157\\n1. Plaintiff’s Personal Responsibility: Ratliff is personally responsible for his failure to participate in the July 10, 2018 telephonic settlement conference, scheduled exclusively for his and his attorney’s participation. He is also personally responsible for failing to appear on July 26, 2018 as ordered by the Court. As outlined in the Court’s Letter Order to Show Cause of July 12, 2018 and on the record during the show cause hearing held on July 26, 2018, Ratliff was clearly aware of both conferences, the requirement that he participate in same and the consequences that could befall him if he failed to participate. Despite this knowledge, Ratliff elected to ignore the Court’s Orders and not participate. This decision was solely his own and he bears full responsibility for same. As such, the Court finds this factor to favor dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice.\\n2. Prejudice to Defendant: Middlesex County has been prejudiced by Ratliff’s failure to prosecute this matter. As described above, the parties have been negotiating the settlement of this matter for many months. Just when it appeared that a full resolution had been reached, Ratliff decided to no longer participate in this case. While Ratliff certainly could not be compelled to agree to settle his claims, he was obliged to continue to participate in this matter. By failing to participate in the telephonic settlement conference or appear at the scheduled show cause hearing, Ratliff abandoned his duty to prosecute his claims. Ratliff’s failure to participate in his own case leaves Middlesex County defending a matter against an absentee plaintiff who has made it clear that he is no longer interested in pursuing his own claims. This is unacceptable and prejudicial to Middlesex County. The Court finds that this prejudice, which was caused by Ratliff’s failure to do that which was required of him, supports the dismissal of Ratliff’s\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 9 of 11 PageID: 158\\nclaims with prejudice. See, e.g., Scarborough v. Eubanks, 747 F.2d 871, 876 (3d Cir. 1984). 3. History of Dilatoriness: Ratliff’s failure to participate in the telephonic settlement conference scheduled exclusively for his benefit as well as his subsequent failure to appear, as ordered, at the July 26, 2018 show cause hearing establishes a recent history of dilatoriness on Ratliff’s part. The Court finds that this factor supports the dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice. 4. Willfulness or Bad Faith: While the circumstances surrounding Ratliff’s failure to participate as ordered by the Court could support a finding of bad faith, even if they did not, they certainly establish that Ratliff’s conduct has been willful. As a result, this factor further supports the dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice. 5. Effectiveness of Alternative Sanction: As already explained in detail, Ratliff was directed to participate in a telephonic settlement conference. When he refused to do so, the Court entered a Letter Order to Show Cause, requiring him to both appear in person to show cause for his failure to participate in the settlement conference and to submit a written explanation regarding this failure. Ratliff was explicitly warned that failing to comply with the Letter Order to Show Cause could result in the dismissal of his claims. Despite being on notice that his claims could be dismissed if he did not comply with the Letter Order to Show Cause, Ratliff failed to appear at the show cause hearing and failed to submit the required written explanation. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that no lesser sanction than dismissal of his claims with prejudice would be effective. See Joyce v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 09-2460 (WJM), 2011 WL 2610098, *2 (D.N.J. June 15, 2011).\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 10 of 11 PageID: 159\\n6. Meritoriousness of the Claims: In light of the proceedings to date, the Court finds it likely that there is some merit to Ratliff’s claims. As such, this particular factor militates against dismissing Ratliff’ claims with prejudice.\\nWhen the Court considers all of the Poulis factors set forth above, the Court finds that on balance they clearly support the dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice. Ratliff voluntarily filed this case. After doing so, he has failed to take the steps necessary to move this case forward. In fact, despite being given every opportunity to litigate his claims, Ratliff has elected to no longer participate in the case he initiated. As a result, this Court respectfully recommends that Ratliff’s claims be dismissed with prejudice.\\nConclusion The Court having given consideration to the Poulis factors; IT IS on this 31st day of July, 2018, RECOMMENDED that Ratliff’s claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE; and it is ORDERED that the Clerk of the Court activate this Report and Recommendation; and it is further ORDERED that defense counsel send a copy of this Report & Recommendation to Ratliff via both text message to Ratliff’s known cell phone number and via regular mail to Ratliff’s last known mailing address immediately upon counsel’s receipt of same; and it is further ORDERED that pursuant to FED.R.CIV.P. 72(b)(2) any party, including Ratliff, who has an objection to the proposed findings and recommendations set forth herein has 14 days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation to file his specific written objections. For purposes of calculating the 14 days, Ratliff will be deemed served from the day defense counsel’s\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 11 of 11 PageID: 160 text message to Ratliff’s cell phone is delivered.

The plaintiffs sued Middlesex County under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for the deprivation of rights secured by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, asked the court to declare that the conditions in solitary confinement were unconstitutional, to enjoin Middlesex County to take all of its inmates out of solitary confinement, and to award costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs claimed that the conditions in C-Pod, the solitary confinement unit in Middlesex County Jail, were unconstitutional. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that they were locked in a small cell alone almost continuously; could not interact with other inmates; could not be visited by family; could not participate in religious, educational or rehabilitative programs; and were never allowed outdoors. \\n\\nThe plaintiffs sought class action status. However, on January 4, 2016, Judge Peter G. Sheridan granted the plaintiffs' request to withdraw their pending motion for class certification without prejudice so that the ACLU attorneys could get acclimated to the case before proceeding with a dispositive motion. \\n\\nThe parties then began settlement conversations. On May 24, 2017, the Court stayed discovery in order to further facilitate the parties’ settlement discussions. The parties reached a settlement with eight of the nine plaintiffs signing the agreement by June 19, 2018. The ninth plaintiff indicated he was not unhappy with the agreement, but did not want to sign. After failing to show and respond to requests to explaining absence from a scheduled conference, Magistrate Judge Tonianne J. Bongiovanni recommended this plaintiff’s claims be dismissed with prejudice. 2018 WL 4006809. Judge Peter G. Sheridan adopted the recommendation and dismissed this plaintiff’s claims with prejudice on August 22, 2018. 2018 WL 4005749.\\n\\nThe eight remaining plaintiffs entered a private settlement agreement with the defendants on September 25, 2018. Under the settlement agreement, the county would continue to operate a precautionary supervision unit, but also provide 28 hours per week out of cells, access to recreation time, in-unit programming, and law library services. Protections used would involve less restrictive security measures. Disciplinary detention could no longer exceed 15 days for a single disciplinary charge and 30 days for multiple disciplinary charges. The county also implemented a mental health screening policy that allowed the director of mental health to stop inappropriate placements in solitary confinement. The settlement agreement permitted the plaintiffs’ counsel access to people detained in the jail, jail records, and the facility itself to ensure full compliance with the settlement. The defendants agreed to pay $11,123 in attorneys’ fees and cost. Under the agreement, any alleged non-compliance would first be brought to the defendant’s counsel, with the opportunity for mediation. The settlement agreement was enforceable for two years. If the mediation failed to resolve the issue, plaintiffs were permitted to move the Court for reinstatement or ask for a one-time one-year extension of the agreement.

Whether they are there for their own protection, for disciplinary reasons, or to separate them from a codefendant while they await trial for years, the conditions are equally deplorable. Plaintiffs are locked in a small cell alone almost continuously, where they languish in a state of forced idleness. They cannot interact with other inmates. Family cannot visit them. They cannot participate in religious, educational or rehabilitative programs. They are never even allowed outdoors. Research shows that such social and environmental deprivations are toxic to the human brain. Instead of promoting public safety, these conditions cause inmates to spiral into mental illness before they are released to the community. Courts, advocates and prison administrators across the country are recognizing the costs of excessive isolation. The\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 2 of 13 PageID: 2\\nconstitutional standards of decency are evolving. Plaintiffs bring this class action seeking to remedy the unconstitutional conditions in C-Pod, and say:\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3) and (4). Plaintiffs bring claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for the deprivation of rights secured by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 2. Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in this judicial district and the parties reside in this district.\\nPARTIES 3. Plaintiff Azariah Lazar is a pretrial detainee housed in “C-Pod” at the Middlesex County Adult Correction Center located at U.S. Route 130 and Apple Orchard Lane, North Brunswick, NJ 08902. Mr. Lazar has been in C-Pod since February 2015. 4. Plaintiff Luis Borrero is awaiting trial and housed in C-Pod. He is also serving a sentence in Pennsylvania. Mr. Borrero has been in C-Pod since June 2015. 5. Plaintiff Hector Amengual is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since May 2014. 6. Plaintiff Sean Pershing is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since September 2015. 7. Plaintiff Tyson Ratliff is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since September 2015. 8. Plaintiff Jonathan Rodriguez is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since September 2015.\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 3 of 13 PageID: 3\\n9. Plaintiff Terrence Edwards is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since October 2015.\\n10. Plaintiff Damani Harris is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since October 2014. 11. Plaintiff Patrick O’Dwyer is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since November 2014. 12. Defendant Middlesex County is a body politic with a principal business address at the County Administration Building, 75 Bayard Street, New Brunswick, NJ 08901. The subdivision of the County responsible for the jail is the Office of Adult Corrections and Youth Services.\\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS 13. Plaintiffs bring this action individually and on behalf of all persons who are now or will be housed in C-Pod during the pendency of this lawsuit, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2). 14. This is a fluid class of about 50 individuals at a given time and is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. 15. There are questions of law or fact common to the class. All individuals in C-Pod are subject to the same conditions, the constitutionality of which will be determined under either the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments. 16. The claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class. 17. The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. There are no conflicts between the Plaintiffs and other class members. No class member has an interest in maintaining the current inhumane conditions in C-Pod.\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 4 of 13 PageID: 4\\n18. The party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\\n19. Plaintiffs have retained competent and experienced counsel who will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. The Public Defender has done substantial work in investigating and identifying potential claims in the action and has experience in handling class actions. This experience includes prosecuting class action claims on behalf of inmates in county jails and state prisons throughout New Jersey. Accordingly, the Public Defender has knowledge of the applicable law and procedures that relate to these claims. Finally, in what can be described as the largest public interest law firm in the State of New Jersey, the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender will commit substantial resources to representing the class.\\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 20. Plaintiffs are inmates housed in an area of the Correction Center known as C-Pod, a cluster of maximum-security cells spanning four levels of the jail. 21. There are about 50 inmates in C-Pod. 22. The cells in C-Pod are smaller than a parking space. They have narrow windows that are sealed shut, many of which are painted over, preventing the inmates from looking outside. Other windows are so dirty that only a faint glow of sunlight comes through. Aside from a small window and a slot for food, the doors are solid metal. 23. The cells are equipped with a combination toilet-sink, a bed with a thin foam mattress, and a small desk. There is no chair for the desk, so inmates must either sit on the concrete floor or the bed.\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 5 of 13 PageID: 5\\n24. In C-Pod, time passes in long silences broken by the sudden outbursts of the mentally ill, who scream, bang on the walls and toilets, and jump on the beds in their cells.\\n25. The air in C-Pod is dusty, tinged with sewage, and inadequately ventilated; it causes some Plaintiffs to have nosebleeds or asthma attacks.\\n26. The air in C-Pod is uncomfortably cold at all times. Inmates are provided with only one, thin blanket, which exacerbates the discomfort.\\n27. The cells are infested with flies, roaches, centipedes and other insects. 28. There is black mold in the shower facilities. 29. Many of the cells have leaky plumbing, causing rank water to pool on the floor. 30. The inmates are confined alone in their cells 5 days a week for 23 hours a day, and 2 days a week for 24 hours. 31. The inmates’ only form of stimuli comes in the form of an antiquated book delivered by library staff. 32. On days when an inmate can leave his cell for an hour, he may not interact with, or even speak to, any other inmates. He may only shower by himself or pace around in one of the small, 10x10 chain-link cages inside C-Pod. Some of the cages face a television controlled by the officer on duty, and some have a telephone that inmates can use if they have sufficient funds. 33. Officers are not always scrupulous in allowing an inmate his full hour. 34. The hourly schedule for when an inmate may leave his cell is not consistent. For example, an inmate may be permitted to leave for an hour at 6 a.m. on one day but 6 p.m. on the following day, meaning he will remain alone in his cell for much longer than 24 hours even during the 5 days he is permitted to leave his cell.\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 6 of 13 PageID: 6\\n35. Unlike inmates in the general population, inmates in C-Pod are never allowed to: A. Eat meals away from their toilets or with other inmates; B. Have in-person visits from family, friends or loved ones; C. Participate in religious groups or services; D. Participate in groups or programs designed to educate or rehabilitate them; E. Access the law library to research their cases; F. Access the computer laboratory; or G. Go outside for exercise, recreation, and their overall well-being, meaning Plaintiff Hector Amengual, for example, has not been exposed to fresh air and natural sunlight for over 1.5 years.\\n36. The inability to go outside or even walk in one direction for more than 10 feet causes inmates a number of physical maladies, such as stiffness of the joints and backaches.\\n37. Unlike inmates in the general population, inmates in C-Pod have restricted access to their attorneys.\\nA. If they do not have sufficient funds to use the telephone in one of the 10x10 cages, an inmate’s only way of contacting his attorney by phone is through a social worker who visits between once a week and once a month.\\nB. Attorneys wishing to meet with an inmate in C-Pod are routinely subject to long wait times and limited timeframes in which to conduct the meeting. For example, the afternoon visitation hours at the Correction Center are between 2-4 p.m., but attorneys wishing to visit with a C-Pod client must wait until 3:30 p.m. to accommodate “window checks” that are scheduled during attorney visitation hours. And when the meetings do occur, they are short and\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 7 of 13 PageID: 7\\nharried because of the time constraints and because there is only one meeting room in the pod. C. Additionally, the physical layout of the attorney-client meeting room impairs an inmate’s access to his attorney. There is no desk or table at which the attorney and client may sit. Instead, the room is divided in two by a chainmetal partition, with the inmate on one side and his attorney on the other. 38. These conditions, separately and in combination, deprive Plaintiffs of the minimal necessities of civilized life and cause them unnecessary pain and suffering. This is of grave constitutional concern. 39. Solitary confinement lasting more than 10 days results in a distinct set of emotional, cognitive, social, and physical pathologies. 40. Solitary confinement creates or exacerbates serious mental health problems and anti-social behavior, and leads to an increased rate of recidivism after release. 1 41. Because solitary confinement deprives the subject of social and environmental stimulation, it is “toxic to brain functioning and causes symptoms characteristic of stupor and delirium.”2 42. Neurological effects may include perceptual distortions, illusions, and hallucinations; panic attacks; difficulties with thinking, concentration, and memory; frightening and uncontrollable fantasies, such as those involving revenge, torture, or mutilation; paranoid and persecutory delusions; and problems with impulse control.\\n1 Vera Institute of Justice Safe Alternatives to Segregation Initiative, Request for Proposals for Technical Assistance Sites, http://www.vera.org/project/safe-alternatives-segregation-initiative. 2 Stuart Grassian, Psychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 Wash.

The motor effects of those subject to solitary confinement range from a state of restlessness, yelling, and banging at one end of the spectrum to a kind of regressed, dissociated, withdrawn, hypnoid state at the other.\\n44. Suicide rates and incidents of self-mutilation (such as banging one’s head against the cell wall) are much higher for people in segregation than those in the general prison population.\\n45. In C-Pod, inmates who exhibit some of these disturbed behaviors are stripped naked and put in a thin mesh gown known as “the chicken suit” and held for hours or days in a cold, empty observation cell without a bed or even a blanket.\\n46. These types of conditions may cause prolonged or permanent psychiatric disability, including impairments which destroy the inmate\\'s capacity to reintegrate into the community upon release.\\n47. Plaintiffs are suffering from some or all of the foregoing effects. 48. The conditions in C-Pod violate the evolving standards of decency in the United States towards incarcerated people.\\nA. The Association of State Correctional Administrators has now recognized solitary confinement as “a grave problem.”3\\nB. Justice Kennedy of the United States Supreme Court recently called on the Judiciary to examine the practice of confining an inmate to near-total isolation for an extended period of time.4\\n3 George Camp et al., New Report on Prisoners in Administrative Segregation Prepared by the Association of State Correctional Administrators and the Arthur Liman Public Interest Program at Yale Law School, http://www.asca.net/system/assets/attachments/8895/ASCA%20LIMAN%20Press%20Release%208-2815.pdf?1441222595. 4 Davis v.

President Obama recently directed the Attorney General to review the overuse of solitary confinement across American prisons.5\\nD. The American Bar Association now recommends that “[s]egregated housing should be for the briefest term and under the least restrictive conditions practicable and consistent with the rationale for placement and with the progress achieved by the prisoner.”6\\nE. The Committee against Torture, the official body established under the United Nations’ Convention against Torture, advocates a “ban [on] solitary confinement regimes in prisons.”7\\n49. Whether solitary confinement should be abolished altogether is debatable. 50. But even if some inmates must be separated, that can be done without the extreme social isolation and sensory deprivations inflicted by the conditions in C-Pod. The conditions in C-Pod are excessive in relation to the purposes assigned to them. 51. There are a number of ways that Defendant can alleviate the harm to which Plaintiffs are subjected, even if they are still confined in C-Pod. Some of these include, but are not limited to: providing access to an outdoor exercise area; increasing the time out of cell; permitting in-person visits with family, friends and loved ones; providing in-cell programming via headphones or speakers in cells that play radio, television or educational information; permitting inmates in C-Pod to interact with one another, such as by eating together; or giving inmates opportunities to increase privileges through good behavior.\\n5 https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/14/remarks-president-naacp-conference. 6 ABA, Standards for Criminal Justice: Treatment of Prisoners 50, Standard 23-2.6 (Rationales for segregated housing) (3d. ed. 2011). 7 U.N.

For example, New York offers prisoners incell programming via headphones and a jack in their cells that plays radio, television, and other programs. Colorado now requires that incarcerated people held in its Management Control Unit receive four hours of time outside their cell each day. Maine requires that incarcerated people in segregated housing receive group recreation, counseling sessions, and opportunities to increase privileges through good behavior, as well as greater access to radios, televisions, and reading materials. And in a national survey of administrative segregation practices, “44 of 46 responding jurisdictions had an outdoor exercise area.”8\\n53. These changes are also financially feasible. Defendant has sufficient resources to remedy its constitutional defects: in 2014, Middlesex County’s total appropriations were $454,043,454, with $12,761,636 in reserves at the end of the fiscal year.9\\n54. The Court should shepherd Defendants into compliance with the evolving standards of decency towards incarcerated people.\\nCAUSES OF ACTION Count I\\nPunishment in Violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution 55.

In the context of prisons, the United States Constitution looks beyond historical conceptions to the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\\n8 Time-In-Cell: The ASCA-Liman 2014 National Survey of Administrative Segregation in Prison 41 (Yale Law Sch.

In light of the known effects of solitary confinement, the conditions in C-Pod are not reasonably related to legitimate purposes.\\n58. These conditions cause inmates deprivations and hardships over an extended period of time and are excessive in relation to the purposes assigned to them.\\n59. Therefore, the conditions in C-Pod constitute punishment of pretrial detainees in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nCount II Cruel and Unusual Punishment in Violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution 60. The above facts are incorporated by reference here as if set forth at length. 61. The United States Constitution requires the government to respect the human attributes even of those who have committed serious crimes. 62. The Eighth Amendment’s scope must change as the basic mores of society change. 63. The conditions of C-Pod deprive inmates of the minimal necessities of civilized life and cause profound and obvious psychological pain and suffering. This suffering is unnecessary and wanton. 64. Under these circumstances, Defendant knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health. 65. Therefore, the conditions in C-Pod inflict cruel and unusual punishment on sentenced inmates, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\\nCount III Restriction on the Right of Access to the Courts\\nin Violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution 66.

The Constitution guarantees inmates a right of access to the courts. This right applies to both criminal proceedings and civil proceedings in which an inmate is challenging the conditions of his confinement.\\n68. Inmates in C-Pod are completely deprived of access to the Correction Center’s law library.\\n69. The conditions in C-Pod restricting attorney visitation severely impair their access to counsel.\\n70. Therefore, detainees in C-Pod are subject to restrictions that impair their right of access to the courts, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF Wherefore, Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the class they represent, ask the Court to: A. Certify this case as a class action; B. Appoint Plaintiffs as class representatives; C. Appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel as class counsel; D. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, declare that the conditions of confinement in C-Pod are\\nunconstitutional; E. Permanently enjoin Defendants and all its officers, employees, and agents to transfer\\ninmates out of C-Pod or take all actions necessary to render the conditions of confinement in C-Pod constitutional; F.

For the reasons that follow, it is respectfully\\n\\nrecommended that Ratliff’s claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\\n\\nBackground and Procedural History\\n\\nOn November 5, 2015, Plaintiffs, who were inmates housed at the Middlesex County Adult\\n\\nCorrection Center in “C-Pod,” a unit for solitary confinement, initiated this litigation by filing their\\n\\nComplaint against Middlesex County, challenging the social and environmental deprivations\\n\\nexperienced by inmates in C-Pod, alleging that said deprivations violated their constitutional\\n\\nrights. (See generally, Pl. Cmplt.; Docket Entry No. 1). Specifically, Plaintiffs brought claims for\\n\\n(1) unconstitutional punishment of pretrial detainees under the Fourteenth Amendment (Count I);\\n\\n(2) cruel and unusual punishment under the Eight Amendment (Count II); and (3) unconstitutional\\n\\nrestrictions on the right of access to the courts under the Fourteenth Amendment. (Id). A week\\n\\nafter Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, they sought to certify a class. (Pl. Motion to Certify Class;\\n\\nDocket Entry No. 3). This motion was ultimately withdrawn at Plaintiffs’ request in order to give\\n\\nthe American Civil Liberties Union (“ACLU”), which had decided to enter an appearance on\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 2 of 11 PageID: 151\\nbehalf of Plaintiffs, an opportunity to become acclimated with the case. (See Letter Order of 1/4/2016; Docket Entry No. 14).\\nMiddlesex County responded to Plaintiffs’ Complaint on December 17, 2015, denying that any constitutional violations had occurred. (See generally, Def. Answer; Docket Entry No. 11). After Defendant answered, the Court scheduled the Initial Conference in this matter. (Initial Scheduling Order of 1/5/2016; Docket Entry No. 15). During the Initial Conference, the Court set a schedule for certain discovery necessary to facilitate the parties’ settlement discussions. (See Scheduling Order of 3/1/2016; Docket Entry No. 21). Said discovery ensued and the parties’ settlement discussions progressed. (See Text Orders of 8/22/2016 & 10/6/2016; Docket Entry Nos. 25 & 26).\\nIn light of the development of the parties’ discussions, the Court scheduled an in-person status conference for January 30, 2017 for the purpose of discussing settlement. (Text Order of 12/6/2016; Docket Entry No. 27).1 During the conference, it became apparent that the parties’ negotiations had progressed significantly, with substantial headway having been made. As a result, the Court arranged to follow up with the parties via telephone on May 24, 2017.\\nOn May 24, 2017, the Court stayed discovery in order to further facilitate the parties’ settlement discussions. The Court also set a schedule for the parties’ exchanges of settlement proposals. (See Letter Order of 5/25/2017; Docket Entry No. 29). The parties continued to exchange settlement proposals and it appeared that a settlement had been reached with 8 of 9 of the named Plaintiffs having signed the settlement agreement by June 19, 2018. The only Plaintiff who had not signed the settlement agreement was Ratliff, though during a conference held on June 19, 2018, counsel indicated that Ratliff was not unhappy with the agreement, but nevertheless did\\n1 The conference was later moved to February 16, 2017. (Letter Order of 1/19/2017; Docket Entry No. 28).\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 3 of 11 PageID: 152\\nnot want to sign same. Given Ratliff’s refusal to sign the settlement agreement, the Court scheduled a telephonic settlement conference exclusively for Ratliff and his attorney for July 10, 2018. (Text Minute Entry of 6/19/2018). As the Court explained:\\nSo I scheduled a telephone conference for July 10th to, again, discuss the settlement with Mr. Duddy and Mr. Ratliff separate from the defendants. It was my intention to explore with him what Mr. Ratliff’s position was, if he had any concerns, if he wasn’t interested in the settlement, all of the concerns that a Court would address when we’re conducting an in-person settlement conference. . . . I thought I could at least tease-out and explore, again, with Mr. Ratliff informally what his concerns were, and perhaps address with Mr. Duddy any of the issues that he had, and maybe eliminate them, and move this along for a settlement. (Tr. of Proceedings of 7/26/2017 at 4:7-22; Docket Entry No.41). However, despite being aware of the scheduled telephonic settlement conference, Ratliff did not participate in same. As a result, on July 12, 2018, the Court entered a Letter Order to Show Cause in which Ratliff was ordered to appear in person before the undersigned on July 26, 2018 at 10:30 a.m. to show cause for his failure to participate in the scheduled July 10, 2018 conference. (Letter Order to Show Cause of 7/12/2018 at 1; Docket Entry No. 39). Ratliff was also directed to submit a written explanation regarding his failure to participate in the July 10, 2018 conference by July 24, 2018. (Id .at 2). Further, Ratliff was specifically warned that if he failed to comply with the Court’s Order to Show Cause, his claims could be dismissed from this matter: Should Plaintiff Ratliff fail to submit the written explanation or fail to appear in person on July 26, 2018 as ordered, both monetary and nonmonetary sanctions may be imposed, including the dismissal of his claims. (Id.) Despite the foregoing, Ratliff neither submitted a written explanation nor appeared in person at the show cause hearing.\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 4 of 11 PageID: 153\\nDuring the show cause hearing, the Court confirmed through his counsel that Ratliff was\\naware of the Court’s Order to Show Cause, the requirement that he submit a written explanation,\\nthe requirement that he appear in person, and the potential dispositive consequences failing to\\ncomply with the Court’s Order could have for him:\\nTHE COURT: I will now turn to, Mr. Duddy, and as I discussed off-the-record with you, I am not interested in encroaching upon your attorney-client communications. What you have a responsibility to do, however, is to report to the Court, did you, in fact, provide this letter order to Mr. Ratliff, as I had instructed? What’s your understanding of whether or not he received this letter; was aware of today’s appearance order to show cause hearing; whether he was aware of the July 24th submission date; and more importantly, if you have any indication of whether or not he intended to participate; and if he has any interest in proceeding with this litigation?\\nThat last aspect, I will note that there have been times where parties have somewhat compelled the Court to move forward while they are not interested in pursuing the litigation, they can’t be bothered, mind you, of even withdrawing the complaint or officially indicating that they no longer want to participate, and then we have to go through these steps.\\nSo, if I could -- that was very longwinded, but, Mr. Duddy, if you outline the steps that you have taken to communicate this letter with Mr. Ratliff, its import, and if you have any indication of whether or not he intended to continue with this litigation. You can remain seated, too.\\nMR. DUDDY: Thank you, Your Honor.\\nOn Monday -- on the morning of Monday, July 16th, I texted Mr. Ratliff a picture of the Court’s order to show cause. And that’s been the way that I’ve been communicating with Mr. Ratliff for some time now, probably going on six months via text message, that is.\\nSo I took a picture of the order to show cause, I text it to him.\\nAlso in the body of my text message, I kind of pointed out or highlighted the substance of the order, which was that he was to provide either me or the Court with a written explanation by July\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 5 of 11 PageID: 154\\n24th as to why he did not participate in the telephone conference on July 10th. And also, that he is to report in person to the Court with me today, July 26th. So, again, that was in the body of my text, in addition to sending him a picture of the order to show cause.\\nThe text message went through to Mr. Ratliff from my end. I then followed up my text message with a phone call to him later that day. He took my phone call, and I then reiterated, again, the body of my text to him verbally and the substance of the Court order, very slowly and clearly, so as to make sure that he understood. And I finished the phone call by asking that he text me back to confirm receipt of my earlier text messages. And he simply just responded “okay” or “fine,” something to that effect.\\nHe did not text me back later that day, or the next day, despite my repeated text messages to him in those days asking for him to confirm receipt.\\nI then mailed -- I overnight via overnight mail a hard copy version of the order to show cause to his last known address in New York, New York. It’s my understanding that that package is being returned, as of yesterday, because the occupant of his last known address is something other than him, and that person would not accept receipt of the package.\\nSo a couple days after that, after my initial text message to him on July 16th -- and I apologize if I’m jumping around -- but I would say July 18th and 19th, I called him two separate times to remind him of the text messages, and to remind him or ask him to confirm receipt of those text messages.\\nEach time I placed that call to him, he took my call. But midway through my explanation to him as to what I was asking him to do, he hung up on me both times.\\nAnd so those were my efforts to ensure that he received the Court’s order to show cause on July 12th.\\nI’m very confident that he did receive the order to show cause via text message. As I said, that has been our custom, that’s been our way of corresponding with one another, and the message did go through on my side.\\nAnd then, of course, in my conversation with him on July 16th, I repeated the substance and import of the order to show cause.\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 6 of 11 PageID: 155\\nSo I am confident that he did receive it, that he did understand the main aspects of it. And he’s not here today, and so I’m also confident that he’s not going to be showing up today before the Court.\\nAnd similarly, it’s my belief that he no longer wants to take part in this litigation, or prosecute this lawsuit of which he is a part.\\nHe did, I will add, finally, for the record, that about a week later -- a week after July 16th, thereabouts, and this would only be a couple days ago, he sent me a text message, seemingly out of the blue, more or less expressing his displeasure with the Middlesex County Jail. The text message neither answered the Court’s order to show cause, nor did it confirm receipt of my delivery of the order to show cause. It was something of an irrelevant non sequitur about some issue entirely different.\\nSo, again, given all those circumstances, I do not believe that he wishes to prosecute this lawsuit.\\nTHE COURT: One question. When you mentioned that you believe he understood the import of the order to show cause, did that include -- is it your impression that Mr. Ratliff realized that he could be dismissed as a complainant in this matter if he did not come forward today?\\nMR. DUDDY: It did include that, Your Honor, and I apologize for leaving that out of my summation here. When I spoke to him -- well, when I texted him the picture of the order to show cause, included in the body of my text was the information that if he did not comply with the order, he could be subject to sanctions/punishment, including his dismissal from the lawsuit, so that was in the body of my text. And I also repeated that to him in my phone conversation on the 16th. I repeated that to him slowly and clearly so as to make sure that he understood that.\\nSo to answer Your Honor’s question, yes, I do believe that he understands that as a consequence of not following through with the order to show cause, he could be dismissed from the lawsuit.\\n(Tr. of Proceedings of 7/26/2017 at 6:1 – 10:13). After confirming the foregoing, the Court\\nindicated its intention to enter a Report and Recommendation, recommending that Ratliff’s claims\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 7 of 11 PageID: 156\\nbe dismissed for “failure to comply with this Court’s orders and, equally as important, to prosecute his case.” (Id. at 11:10-11).\\nAnalysis The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize courts to impose sanctions for failure to provide discovery, obey court orders and/or prosecute a case. See FED.R.CIV.P. 37(b)(2), 41(b). Where such failures have occurred, dismissal may be an appropriate penalty. Id. Generally, in determining whether to impose an involuntary order of dismissal with prejudice, the Court considers the factors set forth in Poulis v. State Farm Casualty Co., 747 F.2d , 863, 868 (3d Cir. 1984). These factors include:\\n(1) The extent of the party’s personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the adversary caused by the plaintiff’s conduct; (3) the history of dilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct of the party or the attorney was willful or in bad faith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which entails an analysis of alternative sanctions; and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim. Id. No single Poulis factor is determinative and dismissal may be appropriate even if some of the factors are not met. See Mindek v. Rigatti, 964 F.2d 1369, 1373 (3d Cir. 1992); Hicks v. Feeney, 850 F.2d 152, 156 (3d Cir. 1988). If a court finds dismissal appropriate under Poulis, it may dismiss an action sua sponte, pursuant to its inherent powers and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). See Iseley v. Bitner, 216 Fed App’x 252, 254-55 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962)). The Court considers the Poulis factors in determining whether to recommend the dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice. For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that under the circumstances presented here, the Poulis factors support the dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice:\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 8 of 11 PageID: 157\\n1. Plaintiff’s Personal Responsibility: Ratliff is personally responsible for his failure to participate in the July 10, 2018 telephonic settlement conference, scheduled exclusively for his and his attorney’s participation. He is also personally responsible for failing to appear on July 26, 2018 as ordered by the Court. As outlined in the Court’s Letter Order to Show Cause of July 12, 2018 and on the record during the show cause hearing held on July 26, 2018, Ratliff was clearly aware of both conferences, the requirement that he participate in same and the consequences that could befall him if he failed to participate. Despite this knowledge, Ratliff elected to ignore the Court’s Orders and not participate. This decision was solely his own and he bears full responsibility for same. As such, the Court finds this factor to favor dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice.\\n2. Prejudice to Defendant: Middlesex County has been prejudiced by Ratliff’s failure to prosecute this matter. As described above, the parties have been negotiating the settlement of this matter for many months. Just when it appeared that a full resolution had been reached, Ratliff decided to no longer participate in this case. While Ratliff certainly could not be compelled to agree to settle his claims, he was obliged to continue to participate in this matter. By failing to participate in the telephonic settlement conference or appear at the scheduled show cause hearing, Ratliff abandoned his duty to prosecute his claims. Ratliff’s failure to participate in his own case leaves Middlesex County defending a matter against an absentee plaintiff who has made it clear that he is no longer interested in pursuing his own claims. This is unacceptable and prejudicial to Middlesex County. The Court finds that this prejudice, which was caused by Ratliff’s failure to do that which was required of him, supports the dismissal of Ratliff’s\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 9 of 11 PageID: 158\\nclaims with prejudice. See, e.g., Scarborough v. Eubanks, 747 F.2d 871, 876 (3d Cir. 1984). 3. History of Dilatoriness: Ratliff’s failure to participate in the telephonic settlement conference scheduled exclusively for his benefit as well as his subsequent failure to appear, as ordered, at the July 26, 2018 show cause hearing establishes a recent history of dilatoriness on Ratliff’s part. The Court finds that this factor supports the dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice. 4. Willfulness or Bad Faith: While the circumstances surrounding Ratliff’s failure to participate as ordered by the Court could support a finding of bad faith, even if they did not, they certainly establish that Ratliff’s conduct has been willful. As a result, this factor further supports the dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice. 5. Effectiveness of Alternative Sanction: As already explained in detail, Ratliff was directed to participate in a telephonic settlement conference. When he refused to do so, the Court entered a Letter Order to Show Cause, requiring him to both appear in person to show cause for his failure to participate in the settlement conference and to submit a written explanation regarding this failure. Ratliff was explicitly warned that failing to comply with the Letter Order to Show Cause could result in the dismissal of his claims. Despite being on notice that his claims could be dismissed if he did not comply with the Letter Order to Show Cause, Ratliff failed to appear at the show cause hearing and failed to submit the required written explanation. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that no lesser sanction than dismissal of his claims with prejudice would be effective. See Joyce v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 09-2460 (WJM), 2011 WL 2610098, *2 (D.N.J. June 15, 2011).\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 10 of 11 PageID: 159\\n6. Meritoriousness of the Claims: In light of the proceedings to date, the Court finds it likely that there is some merit to Ratliff’s claims. As such, this particular factor militates against dismissing Ratliff’ claims with prejudice.\\nWhen the Court considers all of the Poulis factors set forth above, the Court finds that on balance they clearly support the dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice. Ratliff voluntarily filed this case. After doing so, he has failed to take the steps necessary to move this case forward. In fact, despite being given every opportunity to litigate his claims, Ratliff has elected to no longer participate in the case he initiated. As a result, this Court respectfully recommends that Ratliff’s claims be dismissed with prejudice.\\nConclusion The Court having given consideration to the Poulis factors; IT IS on this 31st day of July, 2018, RECOMMENDED that Ratliff’s claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE; and it is ORDERED that the Clerk of the Court activate this Report and Recommendation; and it is further ORDERED that defense counsel send a copy of this Report & Recommendation to Ratliff via both text message to Ratliff’s known cell phone number and via regular mail to Ratliff’s last known mailing address immediately upon counsel’s receipt of same; and it is further ORDERED that pursuant to FED.R.CIV.P. 72(b)(2) any party, including Ratliff, who has an objection to the proposed findings and recommendations set forth herein has 14 days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation to file his specific written objections. For purposes of calculating the 14 days, Ratliff will be deemed served from the day defense counsel’s\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 11 of 11 PageID: 160 text message to Ratliff’s cell phone is delivered.

Irvine is assisted by a designer (usually Taniya Nayak, Cheryl Torrenueva, or Lynn Keagan, but sometimes Vanessa De Leon, Krista Watterworth, Yvette Irene, or Nicole Faccuito), along with general contractor Tom Bury, who sometimes does double duty as both general contractor and designer. After assessing the problems with the restaurant, Robert Irvine typically creates a plan for the new decor, oversees the cleaning of the restaurant, reduces the size of the menu and improves the food, develops a promotional activity, educates the restaurant's owners, or trains the staff, as needed by each restaurant. \n",
